    <h3>Unit 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
<b>
</b>
<p>My website contains 6 different pages: the Home page, Unit 1 Outcome 1,  Unit 1 Outcome 2, Unit 1 Outcome 3, Unit 2 Outcome 1 and Contacts. At the top of each page there is a navigation bar that can take you to any of the other pages of the website. My home page focus is me. It gives a little summary of what I did before code nation, why I enjoy IT as well as why I decided to go to code nation. </p>
</div>
<b>

</b>
<p>Unit 1 Outcome, Unit 1 Outcome 2, Unit 1 Outcome 3 and Unit 2 Outcome are laid out in a similar way as I thought it was best to try and keep them consistent on these pages I have written out the questions using different headings I have used different size headings one for the overall outcome of the unit and smaller headings for questions and then used paragraphs to write my answer to the question adding pictures when necessary for decoration and links to show where I found my research and the contact page simply lists my email address, phone number and linkedin account in case anyone wanted to contact me.  </p>

<div>
    <h3>Unit 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p>When somebody creates a piece of work e.g. a piece of art, photography, software, web content,and databases. Copyright automatically gives the right to protect your work and stop other people from using it without permission, distributing copies for profit and taking credit for your work to name a few. 
        
    </p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p>If people would like to put another person's work on their website they either have to ask for permission from the creator to use it or get a license to use copyrighted material. They also have the option to use works that are classed as public domain which means that the piece of work is not owned by an individual any one can use it. If you break copyright infringement it can lead to substantial penalties, the maximum term of incarceration in the UK is 6 month and or a fine up to £50,000. <a href='https://www.gov.uk/copyright'>[1]</a> </p>

<h3>Unit 1.6  Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>

<b>


</b>
<p>The Web Accessibility Initiative describes requirements for Web access by people with physical, visual, hearing and cognitive or neurological disabilities. Many people who have disabilities need to use alternate websites that are more accessible to help use the web.
</p>

<b>

</b>

<p>People with disabilities can use assistive technologies to help accomplish tasks that they could not complete on their own whilst dealing with the web. These tools use adaptive software, specially designed hardware devices or standard devices used in alternative ways to provide access for the web. </p>

<b>

</b>
<p>Some of examples of tools that help people with disabilities    
    <b>

    </b>       
    <h3>Alternate keyboards or switches</h3>
    <b>

    </b>
    Hardware or software devices, used by people with physical disabilities, that provide an alternate way of creating keystrokes that appear to come from the standard keyboard. Examples include on-screen keyboards, eyegaze keyboards, and sip-and-puff switches. Applications that can be operated entirely from the standard keyboard , with no mouse movements required, support single-switch access or access via alternative keyboards.
    </p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <h3>Screen magnifiers</h3>
    <b>

    </b>

    <p>
        Software used primarily by individuals with low vision that magnifies a portion of the screen for easier viewing. Note that at the same time screen magnifiers make presentations larger, they also reduce the area of the document that may be viewed. Some screen magnifiers therefore offer two views of the screen: one magnified and one default size for navigation.
        </p>
        <b>

        </b>
        <h3>Screen readers</h3>
        <b>

        </b>
        <p>
            Software used by individuals who are blind or have learning disabilities that interprets what is displayed on a screen, and directs it either to speech synthesis, for audio output, or refreshable braille, for tactile output. Some screen readers use the document tree (i.e., the parsed document) as their input. However, older screen readers make use of the rendered version of a document, meaning that document order or structure may be lost (e.g., when tables are used for layout) and their output may be confusing.
            </p>
            <b>

            </b>
            <h3>Braille Keyboards</h3>
            <b>

            </b>
<p>A Braille keyboard is very different than a standard QWERTY keyboard. There are 8 keys which are used to compose the Braille letters. Of course, there are standard QWERTY keyboards which have Braille letters overlaid on them, but Braille keyboards are made in a way which makes navigation and locating the cursor much easier for visually-impaired people.
</p>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Refreshable Braille Displays</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>This is a type of Braille keyboard which also has output options. It contains small pins which can be raised to form the Braille letters. Displays range from 18 to 84 cells. A cursor allows the user to select which text to translate, and the pins are refreshed throughout the reading process. Braille displays are fairly expensive but are good options for people who use the computer a lot, need to speak and type at the same time, or who are deaf-blind and would not be able to use a Screen Reader.
</p>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Sound notification</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>Features of some operating systems that allow deaf or hard of hearing users to receive visual notification that a warning or error sound has been emitted by the computer.</p>


</b>
<h3>Scanning software</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>
    Software used by individuals with some physical or cognitive disabilities that highlights or announces selection choices (e.g., menu items, groups of possible phrases, etc.) one at a time. A user selects a desired item by hitting a switch when the desired item is highlighted or announced.
    </p>
    <b>

    </b>
    <h3>Voice control</h3>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p>Voice recognition is used by people with some physical disabilities or temporary injuries to hands and forearms, as well as some users interested in greater convenience, and as an input method in some voice browsers. Applications that have full keyboard support can be used with voice recognition.<a href='https://monsido.com/tools-web-accessibility-for-disability'>[2]</a>

<h3>Unit 1.7  Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Jpeg</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>For images one of the most commonly used file formats is a jpeg, a jpeg is a compressed data of an image, they are useful as you can save large images as relatively small files but there will usually be a loss in quality. The rate of compression varies depending on size of the file so there is a possibility to balance out the quality of the image.
</p>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Bmp</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>Bmp is a file format that stores raster images. These data files are a bitmap which is a map of colour values for each individual pixel within the image canvas. Bitmaps are used for high fidelity photographic images but because they store high quality images the size of the file makes them impractical for large images.</p>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Gifs</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>A gif is another bitmap (raster image format. It is very popular with simple, non photographics images but it’s colour handling tends to break down with photos and can not handle gradients or colour depth very well. Gif files can be animated, allowing very short video loops to be embedded into otherwise static images. </p>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Png</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>A PNG was created as an improved version of the GIF file. It is also a rasterized, or a bitmapped image file format. A PNG has a much broader colour palette and supports transparency, making it very popular for all sorts of graphic design and publishing work. PNG provides lossless compression, which aids in keeping file sizes down without a loss of quality. </p>

<b>

</b>
<h3>Wav</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>The WAV file format is a (virtually) lossless, uncompressed audio format that preserves a high-fidelity digital reproduction of the sound waves as recorded by a microphone, input device, or digital synthesizer. It is most often used for raw sound samples and short in-app sound effects.</p>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Mp3</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>Probably the most popular audio file format is  the mp3, the mp3 uses lossy compression to lower file size at the expense of sound quality and fidelity. Given the audio equipment most often associated with this file format (headphones and computer speakers), there is not usually a noticeable drop in quality as compared to lossless formats.</p>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Webm</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>WebM is an open video format, primarily conceived for use with relatively short video clips embedded on websites in the context of HTML5 Video. It is a relatively new file format, but it is supported and developed by Google and fills a need not being met by other formats, so its adoption across the web has been very fast. YouTube displays video in WebM format.</p>
<b>

</b>
<h3>Mp4</h3>
<b></b>
<p>MP4 is the successor to MPEG and is based on the QuickTime video format. Compared to the earlier MPEG formats, it has better compression, higher quality (less loss), and can carry more meta-data such as subtitles and chapter headings.</p>
