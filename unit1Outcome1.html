    <h1> Unit 1: Improving Productivity with IT</h1>
<div>



<div>
    <h3>Unit 1.1 Describing the purposw of IT in modern buisiness.</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Information Technology is a vital and integral part of modern day business, it is used from multinational corporations to small
         businesses that only have access to one computer. It is even used in something as hands on as agriculture. 
         Farmers use computers for production record, financial planning, research on technical issues and procurement. With the 
         introduction of computers, the business world has changed forever, companies use information technology to ensure that their 
         departments run smoothly and IT is used in a wide range of departments including human resources, finance, manufacturing and 
         security. Some of the main advantages to IT are a ride in productivity, better communication and improvements in data management.   
    <b></b>
    <p>Information technology helps in developing automated processes for businesses and helps in reducing the cost of operations. 
    This has caused a complete shift of how companies spend their time. Time management has been optimized, and the effort that has 
    been put into everyday tasks has been lightened. This has increased employee productivity allowing employees to focus more important 
    things.    </p>
    <b></b>
    <P>One of the main advantages of IT in modern business is it is now easier than ever before to communicate on a global scale. 
    A good example of this are applications like Skype, Zoom and GoToMeeting allows companies to collaborate virtually in real time 
    from multiple different locations which can reduce costs for companies that  would otherwise have to bring clients on site or who 
    have staff who work remotely. This saves time and increases productivity as it cuts travel time down. Customer communication has 
    also been improved  </P>
    <b></b>
    <p>In the past Data Management and storage had to be stored in a written form which would not only take time but those files had to
be stored somewhere using up valuable space. Thanks to Data Management Systems this is a thing of the past companies can store Terabytes
 of data whilst taking up no physical space. Data Management Systems also don’t require users to regularly and manually back up as they 
 are automatically in case of a crash whereas a written documentation would be lost if it was damaged <a href="https://marketing.pinecc.com/blog/why-is-technology-important-in-business-pine-coves-top-10-reasons">[1]</a>.  </p>

<h3>Unit 1.2 Describing methods,skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
</div>

<div>
<p>At the core of any project is a solid plan and a good plan that has solid goals. So that not only you but people in a team should
be aiming towards to achieve their goals. Creating goals allows you to visualize, plan and document clear objectives and requirements 
that will create a solid foundation for the project.  </p>
<b></b>
<p>One of the most important skills when working on a project are your communication skills, delivering a clear message to you and the 
other members of your team will ensure that everyone completely understands leading to an increase in productivity.
A benefit of good  communication in the workplace is more engaged employees. Employees that are more engaged can better align with 
the project's objectives and goals which will reduce the chances of the project failing. </p>
<b></b>
<p>Being able to assess the risks of your project allows you to identify your projects strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and 
threats. By taking time to plan for unexpected events to throw a wrench in your project, you can be ready to respond if they arise 
and come up with a counterstragise to avoid the project coming to a halt.</p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Unit 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT  </h3>
</div>






<div>
<p>I will be using Trello to plan and help me organize the tasks I need to do when making my website. Trello allows its users to split their tasks between multiple columns and move tasks between them. For example you could separate your tasks between need to do, in progress, complete to show the progress of all your work.This is a link to my Trello, Trello has been a very useful tool whilst planning my website by using the features like the checklist and due date I have been able to prioritise different tasks and work more efficiently.  </p>

</div>

<div>
<h3>Unit 1.4 Describe the risk that might impact digital projects</h3>
</div>

<div>
<p>When working on any project there are no guarantees, your project can always encounter unexpected problems. One of the biggest risks
 is failing to plan ahead, failing to lay out a solid foundation will likely lead the project to fall behind and result in unmet deadlines. 
 Which can lead to overworking members lowering morale and productivity. </p>
<b></b>
<p>This does not mean however that you should rely on a fixed plan with no room for change as this could result in trying to do too much
at once or short term priorities could get in the way.  According to DR Dobbs Agile projects have a 60% percent success rate, 
whereas traditional projects only have a 47% success rate, Agile iterative processes allow for frequent tweaks and improvements. 
Digital projects plans should be flexible otherwise if the specifications for tasks can not be might cause delays and affect the outcome 
of the project. </p>
<b></b>
<p> One of the biggest reasons digital projects result in failure is a lack of communication. Research conducted by the PMI (Project Management Institute) 
found that ineffective communication was the main contributor to project failure and has had a negative impact on project success. 
Without a communication plan, the project contributors will not understand the objective of the project and their role in achieving 
these goals.       </p>
<b></b>
<p>Overall having a weak foundation is going to end up leading to a flawed project as will having and a project with no flexibility that
 cannot be altered and a lack of communication will end up leaving a digital project destined to failure.<a href="https://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/2010-it-project-success-rates/226500046">[2]</a></p>

<div>
<h3>Unit 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
</div>

<div>


<p>Technology compromises a wide range of technology of option and solutions but finding the right for your needs. First of all you have 
to realise what skill do you possess and what skills you are going to need to complete your projects. When deciding you will have to 
realise the impact of what you choose will also have an impact on the team you are working with. You have to know what skills your team 
already has and what can help support them. </p>
<b></b>
<p>Another question you have to ask yourself is what is the company's price range, your company can purchase as much softwares but if 
your company spends more than it’s taking in that will ultimately end up as a failure when you look at different softwares. 
You also have to consider how much time it will take your team to build the functionality in house or piece together existing solutions 
as well as learn how to operate them if the software is new to them. </p>
<b></b>
<p>Brother International in partnership with score released a small business survey that detailed many challenges that small businesses 
face when it comes to adopting new technology. The results were that 63% percent of respondents frequently feel overwhelmed with the 
number of technologies available to run their business. John Wandishin the vice president said: </p>
<b></b>
<p>“Our survey shows that while small business owners understand the value of new technologies, they struggle with choosing the right 
    products, as well as the right time to adopt them to have the greatest impact on their business,”.<a href='https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/how-to-choose-the-right-technology-for-your-small-business'>[3]</a> </p>
<b></b>
<p>The system I personally am most comfortable with after experimenting with different types of software and IT Systems is Window. 
    It's the system I am most comfortable with and in my personal opinion it is a more efficient system when compared to a system 
    like macos. I would also use a range of different applications software  to help for example Trello to help me keep my project 
    organised and it allows you to share data with your team. I would use Slack to help me organize communication by using different 
    channels for both groups and massaging an individual. Another must is Visual Studio code. It is a fast source code editor that is 
    great for day to day use. It has support with multiple languages that helps productivity by highlighting syntax, bracket matching,
     auto-indentation and so much more. It is very easy to customise and has community-contributed keyboard  shortcuts that allow you to 
     navigate your code with ease. </p> 
    </div>

    <div>
<h3>Unit 1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>Trello has been a very useful tool that has allowed me to plan which has drastically improved my productivity when working on my website. An example of this is when I use the list function to create all of the tasks I need to complete. As you can make multiple list I separated them into three different list and called them Need to do, Doing and Done this allowed me to visually see what I need to do and assess which jobs needed to be prioritised and is allowing me to work I can also use checklists within the cards to tick off a task that has multiple steps.    </p>

<h3>Unit 1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - How does GDPR impact digital projects. </h3>
</div>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulations was created in 2016 and implemented into the EU on May 25th 2018. The GDPR objective is to adjust the legal regulations concerning the processing and protection of personal data. This gives the data subjects, a user of online service more control over the processing of their data. Some examples are; </p>
