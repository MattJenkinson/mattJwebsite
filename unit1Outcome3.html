    <h3>Unit 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h3>
    <b>

    </b>
    <h4>Codepen</h4>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p>When using Codepen u can have a section for HTML, CSS and JavaScript in their own little boxes as well as showing both the console, and a screen showing what can be produced from all three of the languages. This can be helpful as you can see your project by just watching one screen in motion without having to leave the editor. These sections are all adjustable so they can be whatever size you need them to be but this leads you to constantly change size for each of the sections depending on which one you're working on. This usually leads you to fiddling with the editor and scrolling for certain bits of code especially when there is an error in the console. I good way for you to be more efficient using Codepen is to work in a team having one person work on each section then once each person has completed their role and add their code to each others project may be a more efficient way of working using Codepen but there is no way without having to send the code through copying and pasting in a different place or manually typing the code.</p>

</b>
<h4>Visual Studio Code </h4>  
<b>

</b>
<p>My personal experience with Visual Studio Code has been a positive one and it has increased the productivity and efficiency of my workflow.  It has a great file management system that integrates easily with Git. The colours and functionalities can be changed with the option that come from the different plug-ins, the code editor itself is put together well and the predictive texts gives you multiple options to choose from which allows you to become more comfortable with the editor and more likely to avoid errors whilst increasing the speed of writing the code. The biggest issue to a new user the editor can be overwhelming it offers so many options that it hard to know to start which can be very off putting compared to a editor like Codepen simple layout.  </p>
<b>

</b>
<h4>Trello</h4>
<b>

</b>
Trello is a useful tool that helps with project management, Trello at its core is an online corkboard you can use to organise cards into lists, and visually see all relevant tasks whilst giving you the flexibility to rearrange them as your priorities change. One of the advantages of trello is that you can add people to trello by them sending their email this way you can multiple people working on tasks set on the cards and constantly change and update other members on what each other are doing, you can also expand on what your doing in the description so that everyone can understand in detail what is being done. The downside to this is you there is a set number of people allowed to be invited to the trello so larger teams would not use the free version of trello they would have to purchase it instead.         


    
    

    <h3>Unit 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and Efficiency.</h3>
    <b>

    </b>
    <p>One way to improve productivity and efficiency are keyboard shortcuts, a keyboard shortcut is where the user selects a series of keys that provides an alternate way that you would typically do with your mouse or keyboard. You can use these shortcuts just for windows or certain programs have their own shortcuts.    </p>
<b>

</b>
<p>Communication is very important weather working in the same building or multiple locations communication is key for efficacy but sometimes itâ€™s not always possible to talk face to face using communication apps like Slack or Twist allow you to instantly message a specific person or team and do a great job of keeping conversation organized and messages eazy to keep track of. Most communication apps allow you to share files so that the team's workflow can be more productive.  </p>    

    
    
    <h3>Unit 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h3>
    <b>

    </b>
<p>You have to test your project to detect and solve any technical issues in the softwares source code whilst assessing the project's overall usability and performance. It is an integral part of the software development process. Whenever there is a problem a good way to test the software is using console.logs to see if the software is running how it is supposed to. If the software is not working you can use the debug tool in Visual Studio Code that will run you through the code and stop when it comes to the mistake you can then review the code and correct any mistakes.   </p>
