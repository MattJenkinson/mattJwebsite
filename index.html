<p>My name is Matthew Jenkinson I was born in Chorlton but when I was three years old I moved to Sale and have lived there since. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, building computers, playing pool and snooker and playing football. I also enjoy doing game jams. This is where you are set a theme and you and a group of people that you know or sometimes complete strangers have to come together and make a game in a short amount of time. This involves creating models, coding for the mechanics, and coming up with the sound as well as many other details for the game. </p>

<p>The thing that sparked my interest in technology was video games. I always enjoyed playing games casually. My first game was Simpsons hit and run on the Playstation 2 and after secondary school the course that interested me most was games development. This is where I learned skills like 3D modelling, 2d animation, 3D animation, Texturing ,and learned basic code using flash. It was not until university where I would get a small glimpse of coding with a basic version of c++ called blueprinting which is what I used to program my honours project.</p>

<p>After University I decided I did not want to continue with the game but while thinking about what job I could go into. I knew that I had always wanted to know how to code properly without using blueprints, so I started looking into software development apprenticeships after a few weeks and a few interviews with no luck. I decided to start taking some free online courses to try and get a basic understanding of different languages and then I found out about Code Nation so I got in touch with their team and that's how I got on to this course.</p>
