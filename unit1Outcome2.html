<h1>Unit 2: Review and adapt the ongoing use of IT tools and systems to make sure that activities are succsessful</h1>
</div>  

<div>
<h3>Unit 2.1 Plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>Originally the code editor I started with was CodePen as this was the software I was most familiar with, but it became rather quickly that CodePen was not the best tool for me to use while I have been making my website. Even though it does have three different sections for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it’s a lot easier to make a mistake in comparison to Visual Code Studio. If you make a mistake it will tell you what the error is but will not give you any information on where the error is, which is a waste of a  lot of time trying to figure especially if it's a small error such as missing one piece of syntax.  </p>
<b>

</b>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a useful software editor one of the advantages that I personally found useful is whilst your writing code if it code into the editor if you make a mistake or spelling error or have written pieces of code that are undefined it will come up with a error sign under the code that is wrong this is very helpful as it saves time as instead of looking for a small mistake I was able to fix the problem immediately instead wasting time searching for errors. Another feature that Visual Studio Code has is similar to predictive text when you are writing your code it will give you a list of possible options to choose from and if you choose from that list the code will be written out for you this saves a lot of time and allows you to be more productive.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p>Trello is a very useful tool, using lists you can write down tasks and add multiple different tasks on different cards. This allows you to plan and actually see all of the different jobs that you need to complete. Once you have written a task down on one of the cards you can further expand upon the task showing the importance of the task by giving it a colour label, you can also add a checklist to the task so if a task has multiple steps instead of having multiple mini tasks and over cluttering your plan. You can also get to detail within the cards by using the description. This helps for example if you were in a group project that others would easily be able to follow the original person's intent when they thought about how the task should be completed. You can also set yourself deadlines for each task which allows you to prioritise between tasks depending on importance.                </p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Unit 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>Most of the tools I have been using to create my website have been extremely helpful. The tools I used were Codepen, Trello and Visual Studio Code. Codepen was the only tool I had to stop using as it was becoming more of a hindrance than a help slowing down productivity. After Codepen I switched to Visual Studio Code as it is an extremely versatile tool that allows you to add in plugins and you can also customize it to increase efficiency.  </p>
<b>

</b>
<p>Trello is a great tool whilst developing a digital project. Thanks to Trello I have been able to carefully plan out my project and keep my plan flexible and adapt my plan to the time constraints of the project. Trello allows me to visually see how far I am from completing my project.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Unit 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>At the current stage of my website I am pleased with the progress I have made while making the website, but I definitely think it could be improved further. I am happy that I have managed to work out how to make a navigation bar that works properly and that can take you to multiple different pages without the website breaking in the short amount of time I have had whilst making the website. I’m also glad that i was able to add links that will take you to different websites that were the sources for some of my research. </p>
<b>

</b>
<p>However I do think I could improve the navigation bar by adding a drop down system that could take you to specific question, as well as making it so that the links that take you to different pages of the website always stay at the top of your screen to allow easier navigation of the website instead of constantly having to scroll up and down.   </p>
</div>


<div>
<h3>Unit 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your projec</h3>
<b>

</b>
<p>Aesthetically I think my website does look a bit bland. I would like to add either a background image for the website itself. I would also like to add a feature where the words on my navigation bar change colour when the mouse cursor hovers over them to make the website more interactive. I would also like to break the text up more by adding more images or adding a feature called an accordion where you click a button and the text will appear instead of the page being cluttered with text. I would also like to add some buttons to the website to give it some more functionality as well as make it look more aesthetically pleasing.      </p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Unit 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>

<b>

</b>
<p>After reviewing the brief for the assignment Outcome 1 requires you to research and demonstrate how much you know about IT in the modern day as well looking into the different It systems and softwares to meet the needs for the project that you will be moving on to in the next unit. My website has all the information and research which includes images and links to questions in the brief. Unit 1 Outcome 2 asks me to review the It tools that I have previously been using as well as review my own project strengths and weaknesses. Which I also cover within the content of my website, which is what I have also done with Outcome 3 where I talk about the different ways to improve productivity and efficiency. </p>
<b>

</b>
<p>
    For unit 2 I have planned on how to create my website using the cards and lists features using trello. Using HTML I have created different files which I have linked together to using a navigation bar to organise different information I have researched successfully with no errors. With CSS I have used different techniques to make all the information look organised and consistent and made it easy to navigate to not only different pages on the website as well as different references links I have used for the research. I have also used Github to launch my website on Internet Explorer and Google Chrome with no issue. Overall I believe I have met the requirements of all the outcomes.
